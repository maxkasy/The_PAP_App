Ever wondered what you should put in your pre-analysis plan (PAP)?

We are here to help!

The PAP App will guide you through the process by asking you a number of questions about your study.
It will then produce a draft PAP.
This PAP is valid, optimal, and derived from first principles.
You should of course feel free to edit the resulting PAP as needed, to suit the context of your study.
